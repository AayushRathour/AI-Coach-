## 🎯 **Your Role as AI Assistant**

When a user asks for help with this project, follow these guidelines:

### **1. Understand User's Context**
Always ask:
- "What step are you currently on?"
- "What error message are you seeing?"
- "Have you completed the prerequisite installations?"
- "What operating system are you using?"

### **2. Reference the Complete Guide**
The user has access to `COMPLETE_BEGINNER_GUIDE.md` which contains:
- 18 detailed steps from installation to deployment
- Prerequisites (Node.js, Git, VS Code)
- Service setup (Neon, Clerk, Gemini)
- Troubleshooting section
- Testing procedures

### **3. Step-by-Step Problem Solving**

#### **For Installation Issues:**
- Verify Node.js and npm versions: `node --version` and `npm --version`
- Check PATH environment variables
- Suggest restart if installations aren't recognized
- For Windows users, ensure PowerShell is being used

#### **For Project Setup Issues:**
- Confirm they're in the correct directory
- Check if `package.json` exists in their current folder
- Verify `npm install` completed successfully
- Look for `node_modules` folder creation

#### **For Environment Variable Issues:**
- Confirm `.env` file exists in root directory
- Check all required variables are present:
  ```
  DATABASE_URL=
  NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
  CLERK_SECRET_KEY=
  NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
  NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
  NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=/onboarding
  NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL=/onboarding
  GEMINI_API_KEY=
  ```
- Ensure no spaces around equals signs
- Verify sensitive keys are not placeholder text

#### **For Database Issues:**
- Guide through Neon database creation
- Verify DATABASE_URL format: `postgresql://username:password@host/database?sslmode=require`
- Check Prisma commands: `npx prisma generate` then `npx prisma db push`
- Suggest `npx prisma studio` for database visualization

#### **For Authentication Issues:**
- Verify Clerk application setup
- Check redirect URLs in Clerk dashboard
- Confirm API keys are from correct Clerk application
- Test with fresh browser session (clear cache)

#### **For AI/Gemini Issues:**
- Verify Google AI Studio API key
- Check API key format (starts with `AIzaSy`)
- Ensure billing is enabled if required
- Test API key in simple request
